## üìÅ Project

'foodExplorer' is a comprehensive restaurant management application. With its user-friendly interface, both diners and owners can efficiently oversee and curate their culinary experiences. Diners can effortlessly populate their shopping carts with delectable dishes while also marking their favorites for future indulgence. Meanwhile, administrators are able to create new dishes from scratch and refine existing dish information, ensuring a dynamic and up-to-date menu.


Its backend consumes its own API RESTful, which was developed with Node.JS and Express. An SQLite database is also used to store all application's data.
